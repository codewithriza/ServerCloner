# Server Cloner Bot

## Description

This Discord bot helps you clone a server, including roles and channels, from one guild to another.






## Installation

1. Download the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Add your bot token in the `bot.run("paste your token")` line in `main.py`. Take it from your [Discord applications page](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
4. Run the bot using `python3 bot.py`.

## Usage

1. After running the bot (`python3 main.py`), you will be prompted to enter the Guild ID of the server you want to clone. To find the Guild ID, right-click on the server in Discord (ensure developer options are turned on) and select "Copy ID". Paste the ID in the terminal and press Enter.
2. Next, you will be prompted to enter the Guild ID of the server where you want the bot to be copied. Paste the ID of the new server and press Enter.
3. The bot will clone the server with all roles and channels within seconds. Make sure the bot is present in both servers with admin permissions.
